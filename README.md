# ATM Management System

The ATM Simulator system is a Java-based software project that simulates the functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using Java, JDBC (Java Database Connectivity), and MySQL for database management. This project aims to provide a realistic and interactive experience for users to perform common ATM operations, such as:  
i.    Account Balance Inquiry  
ii.   Create an Account  
iii.  Pin Change  
iv.   Virtual Withdrawl  
v.    Virtual Deposit  
vi.   Fast Cash    
vii.  Mini Statement
